# Configuration file for MySQL metrics collection
# Please refer to the following examples based on your specific deployment scenario...
# Please remember to enable root user access to the DB instance in question from the host where xcollector is running.
#
# Example 1: To enable metrics gathering for a dedicated mysql instance running on a host (either local or remote)
#       my_hosted_mysql:
#           connect_host: "<hostname/ip to connect to e.g. localhost / 192.168.1.123>"
#           connect_port: <port to connect to e.g. 3306 (default mysql port)>
#           username: "root"
#           password: "<root password>"
#
# In this case a host tag is added to each metric of this MySQL instance which is same as the host on which the
# collector is running.
#
# Example 2: To gather metrics from a remotely hosted cloud instance like Amazon AWS Aurora / RDS
#       my_aws_aurora:
#           connect_host: "<Aurora / RDS connection endpoint
#                                     e.g.  mycluster.cluster-123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com>"
#           connect_port: <port to connect to e.g. 3306 (default mysql port)>
#           username: "root"
#           password: "<root password>"
#           tags:
#               instance_id: "<instance ID of Aurora/RDS instance in question e.g. mycluster>"
#               host: "__..skip_tag..__"
#
# In this case you might want to add a custom tag which helps you identify the specific instance while querying
# for metrics later or while making dashboards with them. In this case, the instance ID of the monitored Aurora
# instance. Please note that we are deliberately skipping the host tag (by setting it to a value of
# "__..skip_tag..__" as it does not make sense to identify metrics specific to this instance with a hostname.
#
# Example 3: To configure metrics collection for GCP cloud SQL instance which is running a proxy on local host
#            This configuration is much too similar to AWS Aurora except the fact that the collector needs to
#            connect to proxy running on the localhost for fetching metrics which is not an ideal "host" tag value
#            to identify metrics from this machine.
#       my_gcp_cloudsql:
#           connect_host: "<localhost as proxy is running on the same host as xcollector>"
#           connect_port: <port to connect to e.g. 3306 (default mysql port)>
#           username: "root"
#           password: "<root password>"
#           tags:
#               host: "<global IP of the GCP instance being monitored e.g., 35.202.128.2>"
#               instance_connection_name: "<a unique instance ID from the GCP console
#                                                 e.g. central-equinox-178205:us-central1:grafana-mysql>"
